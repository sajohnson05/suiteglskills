# NetSuite SuiteQL Skills for Claude Code

A production-grade SuiteQL skill system for Claude Code.

This repository helps Claude behave like a practical NetSuite reporting engineer by combining:
- specialized skills
- reusable context
- debug workflows
- performance guidance
- proven query patterns

---

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/sajohnson05/suiteglskills.git
cd suiteglskills

2. Review key context files

- context/netsuite_patterns.md
- context/netsuite_rules.md
- context/known_issues.md

3. Validate skills

./validate-skills.sh

4. Install into Claude Code

npx skills add https://github.com/sajohnson05/suiteglskills

5. Start using

Example:

Show me open purchase orders with vendor, department, and job

---

## What This System Does

- Writes production-ready SuiteQL
- Debugs broken queries
- Rewrites existing queries safely
- Optimizes queries for Power BI / ODBC
- Translates business questions into query design
- Uses proven NetSuite patterns

---

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four layers:

- `skills/` for specialized Claude Code skills
- `context/` for reusable NetSuite reference material
- `flows/` for multi-step orchestration
- `examples/` for prompts, edge cases, and regression checks

## Why this fixes it
The key is:
- use triple backticks
- use `text` after the opening fence
- keep the tree fully inside the code block
- do not let GitHub render it as normal paragraph text

---

## Quick terminal commands to update README and push

From your repo root:

```powershell
code README.md
```

## How to Use in Claude Code

### Write a Query

Show me open purchase orders with vendor, buyer, and job

---

### Debug a Query

This query duplicates rows and totals are wrong:

[paste query]

---

### Optimize for Power BI

Optimize this query for Power BI refresh:

[paste query]

---

### Start from Business Question

Show backlog sold but not shipped by department

---

## Skill Usage Guide

suiteql-analyst  
- Use for business questions

suiteql-architect  
- Defines joins and structure

suiteql-writer  
- Writes queries

suiteql-rewriter  
- Fixes existing queries without full rewrite

suiteql-validator  
- Checks correctness and duplication

suiteql-debugger  
- Fixes errors

suiteql-performance  
- Optimizes queries for speed and reporting

suiteql-intake  
- Summarizes request

suiteql-root-cause  
- Identifies issue

---

## Core Context Files

netsuite_patterns.md  
- Proven queries

netsuite_rules.md  
- SuiteQL rules

known_issues.md  
- Common failures

odbc_powerbi_rules.md  
- Reporting optimization

portability.md  
- Adapting to other NetSuite environments

index.md  
- Context navigation

---

## Debug Workflow

Located in:

flows/debug_suiteql_orchestrator.md

Steps:
1. Intake  
2. Root Cause  
3. Rewrite  
4. Validate  

---

## Validation

Run:

./validate-skills.sh

---

## Design Principles

- working SQL > perfect SQL
- reuse proven patterns
- preserve working logic
- define grain first
- avoid duplicate rows
- optimize for extraction

---

## Contribution Standard

- keep changes focused
- reuse patterns
- document new learnings
- avoid generic SQL advice
- validate before commit

Good contributions:
- new patterns
- debug fixes
- performance improvements

Avoid:
- theory without application
- unsupported assumptions

---

## Portability

This repo is based on one NetSuite environment.

Other users should:
- add their own patterns
- validate fields locally
- update known issues

---

## Final Note

This is not a prompt library.

This is a structured SuiteQL system for real-world use.
